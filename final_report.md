# Macroeconomic Assumptions

Macroeconomic Assumptions for FY 2023-24

1. Overview: The macroeconomic environment for FY 2023-24 presents a complex landscape shaped by various internal and external factors.  This report's analysis of key macroeconomic indicators provides context for understanding the fiscal planning and execution for the current fiscal year.  A detailed examination of GDP and inflation, based on available data, is crucial for interpreting the economic backdrop against which the budget is being executed.

2. GDP Analysis:  The nominal GDP for the preceding fiscal year reached 83,995.00.  This figure serves as a baseline for evaluating economic growth in FY 2023-24.  A larger GDP suggests a greater overall economic output, which can positively influence government revenue streams and provide greater fiscal space for expenditure.  Conversely, any slowdown in GDP growth compared to the previous fiscal year could necessitate adjustments to budgetary allocations and fiscal strategies.  Further analysis correlating this GDP figure with other economic data, such as employment and investment, is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the current economic momentum.

3. Inflation Analysis:  The inflation rate in the previous fiscal year stood at 29.20%. This level of inflation has significant ramifications for purchasing power, monetary policy, and government finances.  A high inflation rate erodes the real value of incomes and savings, potentially impacting consumer spending and overall economic activity.  It also presents challenges for monetary policy, often leading to adjustments in interest rates to control inflation.  Furthermore, high inflation can affect government finances by increasing the cost of goods and services procured by the public sector.  Understanding the underlying drivers of this inflation rate and forecasting its trajectory for FY 2023-24 is essential for effective fiscal management.

4. Trends and Outlook: A comprehensive assessment of current macroeconomic conditions requires a comparative analysis with historical data for these indicators.  Examining trends in GDP growth and inflation over previous years can reveal underlying economic patterns and inform projections for the current fiscal year.  For example, a consistent upward trend in GDP growth would suggest a positive economic outlook, while a sustained high inflation rate could signal potential challenges for fiscal stability.  Understanding these historical trends is crucial for making informed fiscal decisions and ensuring that the budget is aligned with the prevailing economic realities of FY 2023-24.

# Analysis of Receipts - 3.1.1 Provincial General Revenue Receipts

**Provincial General Revenue Receipts (FY 2023-24)**

1. **General Overview of Provincial General Revenue Receipts**

General Revenue Receipts (GRR) constitute a cornerstone of the provincial budget, providing the financial resources necessary to fund essential public services and investments.  A robust GRR base is crucial for maintaining fiscal stability and ensuring the government's capacity to meet its spending obligations. The three primary components of GRR are the Federal Divisible Pool (FDP), Provincial Tax Revenue, and Provincial Non-Tax Revenue.  Historically, revenue trends have played a significant role in shaping fiscal policy, influencing decisions on public expenditure, debt management, and overall economic development strategy.  Understanding these historical patterns is crucial for effective budget planning and execution.

2. **Performance vs. Budget Targets**

In FY 2023-24, the province's actual GRR collection presented a mixed picture when compared to the budget estimates.

The FDP, a crucial component of provincial finances, recorded a year-over-year growth of 0.24% against the budgeted target, reaching Rs. 2560.63 billion. However, this figure represents only 94.61% achievement of the budgetary target.  Provincial tax revenue also experienced slower-than-anticipated growth, registering a 0.10% increase compared to the previous fiscal year, achieving 86.79% of the projected target with actual collections of Rs. 341.54 billion.  In contrast, provincial non-tax revenue demonstrated stronger performance, achieving a year-over-year growth of 0.32% and reaching Rs. 153.39 billion. While this growth is encouraging, it only constitutes 66.17% of the budgeted target.  These variations in revenue performance highlight the complex interplay of economic conditions, policy decisions, and administrative efficiency in influencing revenue outcomes.

3. **Analysis of Key Indicators**

The Federal Divisible Pool (FDP) reached Rs. 2560.63 billion in FY 2023-24, falling short of the target of Rs. 2706.41 billion but exceeding the previous year's collection of Rs. 2065.15 billion. Provincial Tax Revenue stood at Rs. 341.54 billion, against a target of Rs. 393.51 billion and a previous year's figure of Rs. 309.69 billion. Provincial Non-Tax Revenue amounted to Rs. 153.39 billion, compared to a target of Rs. 231.81 billion and a previous collection of Rs. 115.97 billion.  Total GRR reached Rs. 3055.56 billion, against a target of Rs. 3331.72 billion and a previous year's figure of Rs. 2490.82 billion.  The FDP shortfall of Rs. -1088.78 billion is a significant concern that requires in-depth analysis and corrective measures.  Comparing these figures with historical performance and trends reveals the extent to which current economic conditions and policy implementations have influenced revenue outcomes.

4. **Causes and Implications**

# Analysis of Receipts - 3.1 Total Provincial Receipts

## Analysis of Receipts: Total Provincial Receipts (TPR) for FY 2023-24

**1. Overview of Total Provincial Receipts (TPR)**

Total Provincial Receipts (TPR) represent the aggregate revenue inflows accruing to the provincial government during a fiscal year.  These receipts are crucial for funding public services and development initiatives.  TPR comprises two primary components: General Revenue Receipts (GRR) and Total Capital Receipts. GRR encompasses resources derived from the Federal Divisible Pool, provincial taxes (e.g., sales tax on services, property tax), and non-tax revenue (e.g., fees, fines, and permits).  Total Capital Receipts include inflows from domestic loans, recoveries of disbursed loans, and borrowings specifically allocated for State Trading enterprises.  Historically, GRR has constituted the larger share of TPR, reflecting the province's dependence on shared federal resources and its own tax base.  Analysis of historical trends reveals the evolving composition of TPR, influenced by factors such as federal-provincial fiscal arrangements, economic growth, and provincial tax policy.  Understanding the historical context is essential for interpreting current year performance and projecting future revenue streams. The budgeted versus actual performance of these components provides a critical assessment of the province's revenue mobilization efforts and their alignment with fiscal targets.  Expected growth, based on budgetary projections and economic forecasts, informs resource allocation decisions and policy adjustments.
